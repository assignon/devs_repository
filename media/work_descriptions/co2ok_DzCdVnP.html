    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p>
        For our graduate assignment we have been assigned Milo de Vries (founder of co2ok) of Co2OK as client.
        CO2OK currently has 2 websites online. Those are the following websites:
        https://Co2ok.ninja and https://Co2ok.eco.

        Milo would like to combine this with a fresh design. This will then become 1 entire website. The owners of the webshops could
        also log in to this website. They should then see a dashboard. On this dashboard they can save plugin settings and read/display
        data in the form as statistics.

    <h2>Content</h2>

        The delivered product will look like this:
        1 general website where you can find information about CO2OK, the extension and plug-in.
        Users of the extension can then log in to this website and see how much Co2 emissions they have avoided. 
        Webshop owners can log in to this site and adjust settings of the CO2OK plug-in. They will also be able to read 
        the plug-in's data as statistics.

    <h2>Researches</h2>
    <p>
        During our research on CO2OK, we came to the following conclusions:
        CO2OK aims to combat climate change. They do this by approaching webshop owners to use the CO2OK plug-in. 
        The webshop owners must then install the CO2OK plug-in on their website. When that is done, users who have 
        a CO2OK extension can make online purchases and shop climate neutral.
        In addition to working at CO2OK, the owners also work part-time elsewhere. 
        So they put a lot of energy and money into their startup. Milo can also program himself, 
        he mainly specializes in Python with Django as the framework.

    <h2>Technics</h2>
    <p>
        This project was written in Python web framework <span style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>Django</span>, with <span
            style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>SQLite</span> as DBMS and <span style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>Vuejs</span> as frontend framework. 
        We use django as an Api to be able to connect the frontend and send data between both. <span style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>django rest framework</span>
        is used to turn the django app to an API and <span style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>axios</span> to make request from the frontend.
