    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p>
        To lower the reservation threshold, the Shmovers have been asked to create a reservation system for In-Ki Shiatsu.
        This will be part of the existing website, where it will be added to the contact page via an iframe.

        For people who prefer to do their research via the internet. Shmove Reservations is an online reservation system for
        In-Ki
        Shiatsu that focuses on removing the barrier to making a reservation at the practice. In
        Unlike Qi Studio and Valkshiatsu, we make it easy to book an appointment online.
        The system consists of two parts. The customer side, where the customer has the opportunity to see available places and
        make an appointment. A site administrator side or the dashboard. It is only accessible to the site administrator. You
        can see through the dashboard
        <ul>
            <li>how many appointments have been made</li>
            <li>customers make appointments by phone</li>
            <li>plan vacation</li>
            <li>adjust timeslots</li>
            <li>delete or modify appointments</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Researches</h2>
    <p>
        To find out more about customer behavior with regard to booking, we have a survey
        drawn up.<br/>
        <img src="" alt=""><br/><br/>
        <strong>Data Analyse</strong><br />
        At the time of writing, about 47% make an appointment by phone, 33% via the internet and 20% walk in. Of the 47% who now
        make an appointment by phone, 10 out of 76, or 13%, have explicitly stated that they would like to book via the
        internet. None of the customers who book via the internet indicated that they would prefer to do this by telephone. Of
        the people who book by telephone or walk in, 13 out of 76 indicated that nothing needs to be changed / improved. In
        other words, 17% are happy with the current system.<br/><br/>
        <strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
        There is certainly a need for an online reservation system for hairdressers. Although there is also a group that does
        not want to switch, these people must also be taken into account.
        Most of the reservations are for within the same week.

    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>
        We have built this reservation application over a period of 4 sprints (2 weeks per sprint). We always had a goal
        for
        each sprint, for example building the "Minimal Viable Product." The first two sprints we focused on creating a
        hairdressing reservation system. Halfway through the project, we switched to a reservation system for In-Ki
        Shiatsu.
        This meant that we were going to make a really useful product for a real customer!

    <h2>Technics</h2>
    <p>
        This project was written in Python web framework <span style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>Django</span>, with <span
            style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>SQLite</span> as DBMS and <span style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>Vuejs</span> as frontend framework. 
        We use django as an Api to be able to connect the frontend and send data between both. <span style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>django rest framework</span>
        is used to turn the django app to an API and <span style='color:#54bf8e; font-weight:bold;'>axios</span> to make request from the frontend.
